   * Base route configuration

   *   - '/' is used for all user-facing routes.
   *
   * Future usage:
   *   - For multi-role applications, define base paths like:
   *     - /backoffice → Admin panel
   *     - /staff      → Internal staff panel
   *
   * Keeping this structure allows route grouping & cleaner path management.
